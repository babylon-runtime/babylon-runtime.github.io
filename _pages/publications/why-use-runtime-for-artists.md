# Why artists should use _runtime

![runtime-for-artists-chapo](why-use-runtime-for-artists/runtime-for-artists-chapo.jpg)

## Behind the scene

When I (Vincent Lamy, aka [V!nc3r](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/Vinc3r/summary)) first started to get my hands into webGL through Babylon.JS (BJS), while I was used to Unity3D engine I'm not going to hide that I was a little frightened - but also intrigued: relatively new technology, raw javascript, no official graphic editor, no PBR, no lighting engine...

Actually there is an [editor](http://editor.babylonjs.com/) made by a [BJS user](https://github.com/julien-moreau), which is a great piece of work but our workflow soon get into problematics: artists often need to export & re-export 3D scenes multiple times in a day, and unfortunatly by using the editor you're loosing all your wonderful modifications on the BJS side! Plus as a team we need to work at the same time on our applications.

That's why in 2016, my teamate (Fabien Le Vavasseur aka [sharp](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/sharp/summary)) had in mind to create a kind of overlay of BJS to help me speed up my tasks and not be limited by my javascript skills, named **\_runtime**.

![_runtime-logo-tiny](why-use-runtime-for-artists/_runtime-logo-tiny.png)

This tool allows me this kind of efficient worklow:

1. Export my scene from Blender (or any 3D modeler),
2. Tweak materials and interactions in BabylonJS,
3. Come back to Blender to make some modifications, then re-export my scene to BJS...
4. ... and not loosing any of my tweaks!

We call this not-loosed-modifications: **patches**.

## Time to \_run

So, why an artist would like \_runtime? Because it will not only avoid you to loose some of your tweaks, but also make more easy to write, read and maintain your application.

Assuming we have the good practice to name our assets, we can take as example the need to:

- tweak albedoColor and roughness for all materials using `woods` in their names
- enable collisions on all meshes with `_coll` in their names (cameras also of course)

Here how to patch our scene, showing both raw javascript & \_runtime solutions:

raw javascript:
```javascript
scene.materials.forEach(function(mtl){
    if(mtl.name.indexOf("woods") != -1){
        mtl.albedoColor = new BABYLON.Color3.FromHexString("#ffe1b2");
        mtl.roughness = 0.8;
    }
});
scene.meshes.forEach(function(msh){
    if(msh.name.indexOf("_coll") != -1){
        msh.checkCollisions = true;
    }
});
scene.cameras.forEach(function(cam){
    cam.checkCollisions = true;
});
```
\_runtime:
```javascript
_r.patch([
    {
        "*woods*":{
            albedoColor: "#ffe1b2",
            roughness: 0.8
        }
    },
    {
        "*_coll*, *:camera":{
            checkCollisions: true
        }
    }
]);
```

> notice the "\*" char which means "no matter what characters you found here"

If you're not very comfortable with code, as most artists are, you probably already understand how \_runtime could benefit to you.

I often had to deal with hundred of materials, and be able to patch one particular or a bunch of them in a short time is enjoyable. Plus when you work with other artists, they can quickly find and modify an existing patch (a simple Ctrl+F and you're ready to go).

## Launch & See

And what about just load a 3D model? Let's take an example using this [cornellBox scene](https://github.com/babylon-runtime/_r.assets/blob/master/cornellBox/exports/glb/cornellBox.glb).

Using classic workflow, you will get this basic html setup:

```javascript
<body>
    <canvas id='canvas'></canvas>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
        var engine = new BABYLON.Engine(canvas, true);
        var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);
        // default camera, waiting to use the imported one
        scene.createDefaultCamera();
        // we need an env map as we are in PBR
        scene.createDefaultEnvironment({
            createGround: false,
            createSkybox: false
        });

        BABYLON.SceneLoader.Append(
            "",
            "cornellBox.glb",
            scene,
            function () {
                // activating imported camera
                var camera = scene.getCameraByName("Camera");
                camera.attachControl(canvas, true);
                scene.activeCamera = camera;
            });

        engine.runRenderLoop(function () {
            scene.render();
        });

        window.addEventListener("resize", function () {
            engine.resize();
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

As for \_runtime, you just have to use the `_r.launch` function:

```javascript
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        _r.launch({
            scene: "cornellBox.glb",
            // activating imported camera
            activeCamera: "Camera",
            beforeFirstRender: function () {
                // we need an env map as we are in PBR
                _r.scene.createDefaultEnvironment({
                    createGround: false,
                    createSkybox: false
                });
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

It just works!

Demo: [![Edit babylonjs-with-runtime](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Vinc3r/codesandbox-project/tree/master/BabylonJS/_runtime/publications/why-artists-should-use?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)

Now, how to patch our scene? Easiest way to do so is to call our patches during launch. Try to guess what each patch is doing:

```javascript
_r.launch({
    scene: "cornellBox.glb",
    // activating imported camera
    activeCamera: "Camera",
    patch: [{
            "*.wall01.*": {
                albedoColor: "green"
            }
        }, {
            "*.wall02.*": {
                albedoColor: "red"
            }
        }, {
            "suzanne.000": {
                metallic: 1,
                roughness: 0.15
            }
        },
        {
            "_r.000, bjs-logo.000": {
                unlit: true,
                disableLighting: true
            }
        },
        {
            "Camera": {
                speed: 0.1,
                minZ: 0.01
            }
        }
    ],
    beforeFirstRender: function () {
        // uncomment below to launch the Inspector
        // _r.scene.debugLayer.show();

        // we need an env map as we are in PBR
        _r.scene.createDefaultEnvironment({
            createGround: false,
            createSkybox: false
        });
    }
});
```

## Tool's potential

As seen below, \_runtime is speeding up and improving the way an artist can create a 3D scene and its material's tweaking. But it doesn't stop there! In the same way, you'll be able to create and manage every parts of your 3D application, as [cameras](https://codesandbox.io/s/switch-camera-example-qbrew?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark), animations, user interactions, scene's graphic settings, and every cool possibilities that Babylon is offering us to imagine and build our own 3D worlds. 

Below you'll find a bunch of screenshots from 3D applications running with the great help of \_runtime. They were made by the team of Axeon Software, composed with [Fabien Le Vavasseur](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/sharp/) (core dev of \_runtime), [Sébastien Montlibert](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/devaxeon/) (dev), [Quentin Davy](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/crotmoul) (3D artist) and [myself](https://forum.babylonjs.com/u/Vinc3r/activity) (3D artist playing a bit with code), during the past years (since 2016 actually).

As you will see, all these scenes have a lot of assets, and our little artists team would have pulled each other's hair out if we had to tweak all of these in raw javascript. Even our devs use \_runtime to ease their scripts (similar as using jquery for web).

So, feel free to try \_runtime anytime, it can be easily integrated into an already existing project, without breaking everything, just check the official website to know more: https://babylon-runtime.github.io/

Oh and, yep, it's open source :)
