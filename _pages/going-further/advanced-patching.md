## Mass-patching

### Dancing with the ~~star~~ asterisk

What if we want a bunch of materials using the exact same property? It looks like very annoying to copy-paste a patch for each element, right?

Here comes the `*`! This little char will tell to runtime that `*` = whatever-you-want-characters.

For example, if you have vegetation with many leaves type (and so with many different materials), using `leave` somewhere in their names, you can patch all of these materials in one shot.


```javascript
{
   "*leave*":{
      "useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture": true
   }
}
```

Note that \_runtime is [**case-sensitive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity) (like BabylonJS)!

So in the example above, `oak-leaves.000`, `leavePoplar01.000` and `chestnutleave` materials will be tweaked, but **not** `oakLeaves`.

How to patch also materials using `Leave` *or* `leave`? We could use `*eave*` selector, but it's not very convenient to read an retrieve. That's why we will use multiple selectors.

### Multiple selectors

Sending multiple selectors is very easy to do, just write them successively separated with a comma `,`:

```javascript
{
   "*leave*, *Leave*":{
      "useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture": true
   }
}
```

In the example above, `oak-leaves.000`, `leavePoplar01.000`, `chestnutleave` and `oakLeaves` materials will be tweaked.

### Filters

Using our leaves example, you may be wondering "if somes meshes are named using `leave` too, are they patched also?!".

Answer is yes: actually, if a property doesn't exist on an element, \_runtime will write it as kind-of metadatas (we will [talk about that](../metadatas/) later).

So a mesh will get a new property named `useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture`, but considering our example it is totally useless. Note that adding a new property is not a big deal and should not affect neither performances or engine stability.

How to avoid this? We can use a filter, like `:material`

```javascript
{
   "*leave*:material, *Leave*:material":{
      "useAlphaFromAlbedoTexture": true
   }
}
```

Here only material elements using `leave` or `Leave` in their names will be modified!

See [\_r.select API](../../api/select/) to see all available filters.
