## Conventions

- images should be saved in `/assets/` folder, well named and classified
- image or code caption should be placed below these elements, in italic, starting with a capital letter, ending with punctuation. example:

```markdown
![logo](logo.png)
*This is a beautiful logo.*
```
- \_r should be write in markdown as `\_r` (\\ char is here to avoid conflict with markdown syntax)
- codeblocks should have langage name specified. example: ` ```js `
